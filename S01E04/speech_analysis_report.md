- **Basic understanding of Buddhist philosophy** (three wise monkeys)
- **Elementary neuroscience knowledge** (gamma waves, brain function)
- **Western cultural literacy** (Isaac Newton recognition)

### Potential Mismatches
- **Complex philosophical concepts** expressed in simple language may oversimplify
- **Context switching** from sci-fi to philosophy to neuroscience requires broad knowledge
- **Moral reasoning complexity** may exceed elementary language structure

## 9. Credibility Signals and Evidence

### Authority Markers

- **Scientific observation**: Direct reference to measurable brain activity patterns

### Evidence Quality
- **Specific observations**: "gamma waves," "problem-solving concentration," "they've increased"
- **Cultural accuracy**: Correct Japanese names and Buddhist context
- **Behavioral evidence**: "Look how it's watching us" - direct observation

### Credibility Limitations
- **No quantified measurements** despite scientific claims
- **Mixing fictional and real elements** reduces scientific authority
- **Anthropomorphizing behavior** ("highly intelligent," "watching") without objective criteria

### Concessions and Hedging
- **"I think that's right"** (82.5-84.28s) - acknowledges uncertainty in final assessment
- **Minimal hedging elsewhere** suggests high confidence in presented information
- **Question format** invites dialogue rather than asserting absolute knowledge
