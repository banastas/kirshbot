3. Discourse Structure
	•	Opening observation (0–9s): sounds, embryo reference.
	•	Clarification (9–13s): “No, just one species.”
	•	Philosophical frame (14–37s): proverb of three monkeys.
	•	Ethical interrogation (38–54s): hypothetical “evil” acts.
	•	Reframing adulthood (55–60s).
	•	Observational science (66–74s): gamma waves, intelligence.
	•	Closing (78–84s): naming, “Isaac Newton.”
