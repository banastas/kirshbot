Did you count an adult male, single-handed? This one's a child, peeling three inches of steel and tempered glass. So you're worried about what? Her intellect, her emotions? Why? That's like an onion asking, how do I take care of a star? You think he's gonna let you take her with you. To do what, your sister? has the potential to invent faster-than-light travel and explore the stars for thousands of years. And you want her to be a family? Keep telling yourself that. Look at you, the almost-human, self-hating machine. I must envy me. I don't know what you're talking about. A child, or a body that isn't so sad. See, I would imagine it's the pain that makes it satisfying. Especially for cyborgs. That moment when you realize you're not a machine after all. When the first eyeball pops. Are you in the lab? I had to fly to the mainland for a few hours. There was a meeting with Yutani. I should be back by dark. My creatures need to be fed and watered, check the data from last night, and pick the next experiment from the list. Is Curly with you? Step by step, follow protocols to the letter. The scientific method is a method, not a suggestion box. Affirmative.
